# Arrays

This folder contains my solutions to common array problems written in C++.

While working on these problems, I usually start with a simple (often brute-force) approach to understand what’s really going on.  
After that, I try to improve the solution by reducing time complexity and thinking about edge cases like empty arrays or single-element inputs.
