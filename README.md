# Algorithmic Problem Solving (C++)

I created this repository to build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms using C++.  
Instead of focusing on solving a large number of problems, I focus on understanding how and why a solution works.

## How I approach problems
- Begin with a simple or brute-force solution to understand the problem clearly
- Improve the solution using suitable data structures or patterns
- Analyze time and space complexity for each approach
- Pay attention to edge cases and constraints

## What this repository contains
- Documented solutions to common algorithmic problems
- Explanations of the thought process behind each solution
- Problems organized by topic for structured learning

## Why I’m doing this
My goal is to develop solid problem-solving skills required for software engineering internships and entry-level roles, and to build the habit of writing clear, understandable code.
